# epoll(LT) & Thread pool-based Socket_Response
A epoll(use LT mode) and Thread pool based  Socket_Response(Tcp/ip) ——A small project for personal learning use
This project can implement multiple concurrent long connection communication between the server and the client, using epoll's LT mode, and adding a thread pool to manage the connection and communication threads.
This project is for personal learning, there are still many shortcomings, there may be some bugs, please forgive me, in the future will continue to expand and improve this project.
